anti-pong
=========

A simple pong like game where you catch the ball instead of bouncing it away.

The point of this project was to build something quickly using coffeescript specifically using it's basic class support. Feel free to try it out yourself.

The default controls are as follows:
- left paddle: up = W, down = S
- right paddle: up = [up arrow], down = [down arrow]
